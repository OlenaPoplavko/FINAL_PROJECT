# Weather Cat App

## üìñ Description
**Weather Cat App** is a web application that allows users to check the current weather in any city. Depending on the weather conditions, the app displays a corresponding cat image, making the experience more friendly and fun.

The project was designed as part of a learning program to practice web development skills, focusing on JavaScript, CSS, and API integration.

## üí° Why This Project?
I chose this project because it combines technical learning with creativity. It allowed me to:
1. Practice working with APIs to fetch real-time data.
2. Improve my JavaScript and CSS skills by building interactive and responsive components.
3. Add a fun, personal touch with dynamic cat images, making the app both functional and enjoyable for users.

This project also felt manageable for my current skill level while still providing room for growth and learning.

## üöÄ Key Features
1. Users enter the name of a city.
2. The app sends a request to the OpenWeather API and retrieves:
   - The current temperature.
   - A description of the weather conditions.
3. The app displays:
   - Weather information.
   - A cat image matching the weather description.

## üìã Development Stages

### **1. First Version: Static Data with Alerts**
- Weather data was hardcoded.
- Results were displayed using `alert` for simplicity.
- **Limitations**: Data was static, and the user interface was minimal.

### **2. Second Version: User Input with `prompt`**
- A `prompt` was added to allow the user to enter the name of a city through a popup input field.
- The app compared the input city name with a pre-defined list of cities in the code and returned weather data using `alert`.
- **Limitations**: 
  - The data was still static and limited to a small set of cities.
  - The user interface remained minimal with no dynamic content on the page.

### **3. Third Version: API Integration**
- Real-time weather data is dynamically fetched using the OpenWeather API.
- Results are displayed on the web page through DOM manipulation.
- Cat images corresponding to weather descriptions were added.
- **Advantages**: Real-time data, dynamic content, and improved user experience.

## üìù Ideas for Future Improvements
1. Add a weather forecast for several days.
2. Expand the list of weather descriptions for more cat image variety.
3. Allow users to select a favorite weather condition and see a corresponding cat image.
4. Add basic animations for better user experience (e.g., fading in images or sliding transitions).
